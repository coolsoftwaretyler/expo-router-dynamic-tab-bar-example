# Fancy Tab Bar Example

An example repository companion to [my post about dynamically hiding the tab bar in Expo Router/React Navigation](https://coolsoftware.dev/blog/hide-tab-bar-expo-router-nested-stack/).

## Set up

This repo was built using the [Expo Router quick start](https://docs.expo.dev/router/installation/#quick-start). Assuming you're on a machine [already capable of running an Expo project](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app/), you should be able to:

```sh
npm i
npx expo start
```

And then select Android/iOS as needed.
